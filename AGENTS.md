## What this repo is

The namesake repository for Project Hydra on the `Petatron` org. Today it holds only a stub README
and the licence. Every piece of working code, configuration, and documentation lives in one of the
sibling repos — see the table in [Project context](#project-context) for which.

The most likely eventual home for the **`hydra` CLI** — ADR-001 describes it as a *stateless
orchestrator*, the one architecture decision currently scoped `Product` rather than `Reference lab`
— but that is a proposal, not a commitment, and nothing has been built.

## Before writing anything here

Because the repo has no established scope, the failure mode is an agent inferring one from the name
and creating structure nobody agreed to. So:

1. **Check Linear (`PET`) for an issue that explicitly targets this repository.** If no issue names
   `hydra`, the work almost certainly belongs somewhere else.
2. **Check the linked Notion page** for the decided shape before scaffolding anything — module
   layout, command surface, and language are design decisions, not implementation details.
3. **If neither exists, stop and ask.** Say what you think belongs here and why, rather than
   creating it.

Ask specifically before: adding a language toolchain or build system, adding CI workflows, importing
code from another repo, or turning this into a monorepo. Any of those sets a direction that is hard
to reverse.

## Where the work actually is

| If the change is about… | It belongs in |
|---|---|
| Provider code, CRDs, controllers, reconciliation | `cluster-api-provider-hydra` |
| Runbooks, host prep, cluster bootstrap specs | `hydra-bootstrap` |
| Argo CD Applications, cluster configuration | `hydra-gitops` |
| Terraform for the legacy hand-built workers | `hydra-infra` |
| Architecture, ADRs, design rationale, worklogs | Notion, not a repo |
| Delivery status | Linear, not a repo |

## Housekeeping changes that are fine

Licence, README, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue and PR templates, `.gitignore` — the
open-source surface of the org. Those do not need a design decision first, though they still need a
PET issue and a normal PR.

## Project context

**Hydra** is an open-source on-prem Kubernetes lifecycle platform built on
[Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/), with libvirt/KVM as the first infrastructure
provider and workload-driven node autoscaling via Cluster Autoscaler. It lives on the
[`Petatron`](https://github.com/Petatron) GitHub org across five repositories:

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| [`hydra`](https://github.com/Petatron/hydra) | Umbrella / namesake repo. Effectively empty today. |
| [`cluster-api-provider-hydra`](https://github.com/Petatron/cluster-api-provider-hydra) | The Cluster API **infrastructure provider**. Go, kubebuilder. This is where product code lives. |
| [`hydra-bootstrap`](https://github.com/Petatron/hydra-bootstrap) | **Documentation only.** Runbooks for standing up hosts, the CAPI management cluster, and workload clusters. |
| [`hydra-gitops`](https://github.com/Petatron/hydra-gitops) | Argo CD configuration. **A merge to `main` changes live clusters.** |
| [`hydra-infra`](https://github.com/Petatron/hydra-infra) | Terraform for the pre-Hydra, hand-built worker VMs. Legacy path, being superseded by the provider. |

**Where truth lives — three systems, deliberately separated:**

- **Notion** (PETATRON teamspace → *Project Hydra*) — architecture, ADRs, design docs, runbooks,
  worklogs, validation evidence. This is the source of truth for **engineering knowledge**.
- **Linear** (workspace `petatron`, team key `PET`) — issues `PET-5`..`PET-46+`. Source of truth
  for **delivery status**. `PET-1`..`PET-4` are onboarding stubs, not real work.
- **GitHub** — code, PRs, CI. Not a place to record decisions.

Durable findings go in Notion, **not** Linear comments. Every Linear issue must have a matching
Notion page, linked both ways.

## Working agreements

These are instructions, not suggestions.

### 1. PR titles carry the ticket; commit messages do not

```
PR title:  [PET-27] Publish template capacity for scale-from-zero
Commit:    feat: publish template capacity for scale-from-zero
```

The ticket goes in **square brackets at the front** of the PR title. Commit messages stay in
conventional style (`feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:`) with **no** ticket prefix.
`feat: … (PET-27)` is the wrong shape for a PR title — do not copy it.

**Every PR needs a ticket. If there isn't one, stop and ask.** When the work has no Linear (or Jira)
issue, do not open the PR on your own judgment — ask whether to create a ticket first or to open
this one without a prefix, and let the user decide. **Never invent or guess a number:** a wrong
`[PET-xx]` silently attaches the PR to somebody else's work and corrupts the tracking both systems
exist to provide.

### 2. Never put AI attribution in git history

Commit messages, commit trailers, PR titles, and PR bodies must **never** mention Claude, Codex,
Cursor, Copilot, or any AI assistant. Git history records what changed and why, not which tool
typed it. Never emit:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
Made with [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
```

Nor phrases like "AI-assisted", "generated by AI", or a model name anywhere in a commit message or
PR description. Write them as the human author would.

**Some tools inject attribution after the fact — always verify.** Writing a clean message is not
enough:

```bash
ATTRIB='^Co-authored-by:|Generated with|Made with \[|AI-assisted|generated by AI|Claude Code|claude\.ai|cursor\.com|noreply@anthropic\.com'
git cat-file -p HEAD | grep -iE "$ATTRIB" && echo DIRTY || echo clean
gh pr view <n> --json body --jq '.body' | grep -iE "$ATTRIB" && echo DIRTY || echo clean
```

Match those patterns, **not** the bare words `claude` or `cursor` — `CLAUDE.md` is a legitimate
filename and a loose grep reports every commit that mentions it as dirty.

`git commit --amend` re-injects the trailer and cannot fix this; rebuild the commit object with
`git commit-tree` instead. If the bad commit was already pushed, **ask before force-pushing**, then
use `--force-with-lease=<branch>:<old-sha>`.

### 3. DO attribute yourself in PR comments

This is the exception to rule 2, and it is required. Multiple agents (and the human maintainer)
review the same PRs; the comment thread has to say who is speaking.

**Prefix every GitHub PR comment, review comment, review summary, and reply you write with your
agent name and model in bold:**

```
**Claude (Opus 5)** — the informer starts on the first cached Get, so declining
the Watch bought nothing here. Read the Secret through mgr.GetAPIReader().
```

```
**Codex (GPT-5)** — agreed, but the RBAC verb also needs narrowing to `get`.
```

Format is `**<Agent> (<Model>)**` followed by an em dash. Use the name a reader would recognise —
`Claude (Opus 5)`, `Codex (GPT-5)`, `Cursor (Composer)`. If you genuinely do not know your model
identity, use `**<Agent>**` alone rather than guessing.

This applies to **comments only** — the conversation surface. It does **not** apply to the PR body,
the PR title, or commit messages, which stay clean under rule 2.

GitHub still attributes the comment to whichever account is authenticated. The prefix says which
agent wrote the text; do **not** claim the displayed GitHub author has changed.

### 4. Keep the record current continuously, not at the end

Whenever a ticket, a test, or a meaningful piece of progress completes, update **both**:

- **Linear** — status, plus a comment stating what was proven and, just as importantly, what was
  **not**.
- **Notion** — the linked page's worklog section and its Doc Status property.

Write down what was *learned* — especially anything that turned out different from what was
assumed — not just what shipped. The goal is that a future session resumes with no lost context.

Every operation performed against real infrastructure gets recorded as it happens, in both.

### 5. Read PR review comments via GraphQL, never REST

The REST endpoint `/pulls/N/comments` **silently omits threads** — it missed all eight of the
maintainer's review comments on one PR. Always use `reviewThreads`:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"Petatron",name:"<repo>"){pullRequest(number:N){
  reviewThreads(last:80){nodes{isResolved path line
    comments(first:1){nodes{author{login} createdAt body}}}}}}}'
```

Filter by `createdAt` to find new threads. Do not slice by index against the REST count.

### 6. Expect several review rounds, and verify every comment

Copilot reviews every PR and has found dozens of real defects — several that would only have
surfaced in production as orphaned VMs or wedged finalizers. **Expect 3–5 review rounds per PR.**

Verify each comment against the actual file before acting on it. Some have been stale test
assumptions rather than code bugs, and at least one was a linter firing on a conversion that was
genuinely required. A review comment is evidence, not a verdict.

### 7. Generic design beats lab convenience

The reference lab (an XPS 13 control plane at home, a workstation at the office, ~30 ms apart) is
one person's setup, **not a requirement Hydra should be shaped around**. Hydra must assume nothing
about that hardware, topology, or site count.

When lab convenience and generic design diverge, **generic wins** — unless the shortcut is provably
free, meaning a config value that can change later, not a code path that would have to be undone.

Architecture decisions carry a **Scope** property in Notion: `Product` binds Hydra for everyone,
`Reference lab` describes only that setup. Do not read a lab ADR as a product constraint.
